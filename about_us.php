        <p>Youth Empowerment Consortium -YEC is a registered Company in Ghana as YEC GROUP INITIATIVE LTD with the goal of promoting youth involvement and participation in Governance and Socio Economic Development efforts within the Seven Spheres of Influence in every nation by nurturing , training and mentoring aspiring young political leaders, students, social activist, local community development partners, young professionals, entrepreneurs and all youth of African Descent for transformational leadership.
<br>
There are two factors in Nation Building. There is the Hardware which is Infrastructural Development(Roads, schools, Hospitals etc) and there is the Software which is Human Capital. Our laser focus is on human capital development. 
<br>
The youth forms the largest population mass of most countries of the world and yet they are the most neglected and marginalised in the Development aspirations of these nations because of age, lack of experience, limited opportunities and lack of direction to harness their lives passions, develop their skills and deploy them profitably .
<br>
Yec Seeks to bridge the gab , provide impactful platforms for practice and training to prepare and produce intentional transformational leaders who although young will lead themselves, communities and their nations to their highest levels of performance and achievements.
<br>
We therefore operate on a seven pillar mandate which is the seven spheres of influence in every nation. It is therefore imperative that whoever you are, your life’s passion will be captured within one of our carefully tailored leadership programs. This synchronizes with our policy of not leaving any Youth behind. 

We envision transforming 250,000 youth leaders by 2030
