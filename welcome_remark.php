        <h3>You are welcome to the YEC website. We envision transforming 250 000 youth lives by 2030.</h3><br>
<p>
In the book: good to great, professor Jim Collins and his research team observed that for an organisation or country to move from a good status to greatness requires disciplined people ; disciplined thinking and disciplined placements and action in that order. Real and lasting change begins with Disciplined people; skill is important but secondary to character.<br>

We understand deeply the challenges of the African continent. <br>

In describing the secrets to Singapore development; Lee Kuan Yew, the late former prime minister in his Book, from Third World to first Wrote;.....”we had to train our people , equip and provide them with first world standards of service. I believe this was possible, that we could re educate and re orientate our people with the help of schools, trade unions, community centres and Social Organisations...... and get our people to change their Third World habits”<br>

Changing Third world habits means shifting Mindsets from Corrupt and unproductive mentality to that based on integrity, productivity and innovation.<br>
This was achieved through intensive and deliberate re orientation training programmes deployed on formal, non formal, and informal education platforms.<br>

This attest to the fact that Human capital development is the first step that determines the rate at which a nation is Transformed.<br>
For Africa to transform and experience economic growth, there must be a deliberate effort to raise disciplined and skilled people across the continent. YEC has set a target to help by 2030 about 250 000 Youth in Value reorientation, basic leadership, political Leadership, and Governance so that they will make positive contributions to Nation Building.<br>
</p>
